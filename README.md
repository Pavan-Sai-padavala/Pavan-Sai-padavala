# 👋 Hi, I'm Pavan Sai Padavala

🚀 Backend & Systems-focused engineer who enjoys building and understanding systems from first principles — from implementing DNS and HTTP protocols to studying TLS 1.3 internals.

🔍 Interested in backend infrastructure, systems engineering, and protocol-level development.

---

## 🧠 About Me

I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood.

Rather than only relying on frameworks, I study specifications (IETF RFCs, standards) and implement core components to gain a deeper understanding of protocol design and system architecture.

My recent work includes:

- Building a Python-based CLI tool to automate Java compilation and JAR packaging  
- Implementing a recursive DNS resolver (RFC 1035)  
- Developing a multi-threaded HTTP server using Java sockets  
- Studying TLS 1.3 key exchange and elliptic curve cryptography (RFC 8446)

- ⚙️ Systems & Networking Internals  
- 🔐 Cryptographic Protocols (TLS 1.3, ECDHE)  
- 📜 RFC-driven Development  
- 🧵 Concurrency & Thread Models
